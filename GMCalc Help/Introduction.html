<h1>Introduction to GMCalc</h1>
<strong>GMCalc</strong> is a calculator specifically designed for GMs and roleplayers to use for all manner of RPG hooliganery. A simple die-rolling mode is used by default, but more complex equations can be created for the daring user.
<br /><br />
This Help document will be expanded as development of GMCalc continues.<br /><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> This application is BETA. Actually, it's not even beta. This application is ALPHA. That's about twice as nerdy and half as useful, for the non-technical users reading this. I am not currently aware of any bugs in this release, but the feature set provided is somewhat limited and stability is certainly not guaranteed. Use at your own risk.
