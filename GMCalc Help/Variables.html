<h1>Variables</h1>
<strong>Variables</strong> allow you to store numbers and equations for reuse. There are two system-defined variables available:<br /><br />
<pre>
ans	Contains the resulting value from the last executed equation
last	Contains the original text of the last equation
</pre><br />
Note that repeated use of <code>last</code> (i.e. by repeating the same equation over and over) may result in program lag, as the resultant equation will become longer and longer. To give an example:<br /><br />
<pre>
2d4
-> now 'Last' contains '2d4'
2d(Last)
-> now 'Last' contains '2d(2d4)'
2d(Last)
-> now 'Last' contains '2d(2d(2d4))'
etc
</pre><br />
Use responsibly.<br /><br />
You can define your own variables using the <strong>Variable Editor</strong> available from the <strong>Tools</strong> menu. Select a variable by left-clicking to edit. Insert a variable into your current equation or delete a variable from the list by right-clicking on its row and selecting the appropriate option.<br /><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> <code>ans</code> and <code>last</code> cannot be altered or deleted.
