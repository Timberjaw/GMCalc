<h1>Equations</h1>
<strong>Equations</strong> are the core of GMCalc. Every calculation-even one as simple as <code>2d6</code> takes the form of an equation. GMCalc's equation parser breaks apart the string you entered into a series of values. For example:<br /><br />
<pre>
2d6+1
-> 2d6+1
   ^ ^ ^
   | | |> modifier
   | |> number of faces on each die
   |> number of dice
</pre><br />
More complex expressions can be constructed with the use of parentheses and variables. For example:<br /><br />
<pre>
(2d7)d(4d(2d5))+(2d3)
</pre><br />
This equation would roll a die with 4d(2d5) faces (a number determined by rolling a die with 2d5 faces 4 times) 2d7 times, and then adding a 2d3 modifier. With the use of variables such as <code>last</code>, this example can be made even more absurd.</code>
